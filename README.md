## 2023/12/19 - Day 10 Part 2
Stuck on this one for 4 days. Didn't think I could do it, but we are so back!
I figured out the scanline idea myself, but couldn't get it to work properly. 
Mainly I was missing the part about "U" and "non-U" bends. This [comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/18f1sgh/2023_day_10_part_2_advise_on_part_2/kcripvi/) was really
helpful for getting me back on track.

Alright, I'm leaving this one in 2023. I couldn't do it. I'd rather grind LeetCode than bash my head at this thing until I solve it. Perhaps by next year I will have the necessary skills.
